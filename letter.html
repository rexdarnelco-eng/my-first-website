  <h1>An Open Letter</h1>

  <p>Hi,</p>

  <p>
    This may come as a surprise, but I felt it was better to be honest
    than to keep this to myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    I first saw you at school during the CBSE LOC form period.
    At the time, I reacted casually, but as the days passed,
    I realized how much I miss seeing you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for reading this. No matter your response,
    I wish you the very best.
  </p>

  <p>— Your Name</p>
