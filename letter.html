<h1>An Open Letter</h1>

<div class="letter">
  <p>Hi,</p>

  <p>
    This might come as a surprise, but I wanted to be honest rather than keep this to myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    I first saw you at school during the CBSE LOC form time. At that moment, I reacted casually,
    but as time passed — especially now, at the end of school — I realized how much I miss seeing you
    and how much I wish I had spoken to you then.
  </p>

  <p>
    You don’t know me, not even my name, and I understand that. Still, I wanted to say this respectfully.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like you not just because of how you look, but because of the kind of person you seem to be.
    From what I’ve seen and heard, you feel like someone with a pure heart — strong, kind, and genuine.
    Your nature itself feels beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    There’s absolutely no pressure or expectation from you. I just wanted to express what I feel honestly.
    If you’re open to it, I’d really like to talk and get to know you better someday.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for reading this, and I wish you nothing but the best, no matter your answer.
  </p>

  <p class="signature">
    — Your Name
  </p>
