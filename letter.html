    <h1>An Open Letter</h1>

    <p>Hi,</p>

    <p>
      This may come unexpectedly, but I felt it was better to be honest than to leave these feelings unspoken.
    </p>

    <p>
      I first noticed you at school during the CBSE LOC form time. I didn’t think much of it then,
      but as time passed — especially now, at the end of school — I realized how much I missed seeing you
      and how much I wished I had spoken to you at that moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t know me, not even my name, and I understand that completely. Still, I wanted to say this with respect.
    </p>

    <p>
      I admire you not only for how you look, but for the kind of person you seem to be.
      From what I’ve seen and you've shared, you come across as someone kind, strong, and genuine.
      There’s a quiet sincerity about you that feels truly beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
      There’s no pressure or expectation behind this message. I simply wanted to express how I feel honestly.
      If you’re ever open to it, I’d be happy to talk and get to know you better someday.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for reading this, and I wish you nothing but happiness, regardless of your answer.
    </p>
